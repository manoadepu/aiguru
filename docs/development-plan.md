# AI Agent Teacher Application: Phased Development Plan

This document outlines the phased development approach for building the AI Agent Teacher application MVP.

## Phase 1: Foundation (2-3 weeks)

### Technical Setup
- Create project repositories (frontend, backend)
- Set up React frontend skeleton with routing
- Implement backend API framework (Python FastAPI or Node.js Express)
- Configure basic PostgreSQL database schema
- Set up CI/CD pipeline with automated testing

### Core Features
- User authentication (parent accounts)
- Basic profile creation for children
- Simple database schema for storing profiles
- API endpoints for profile management

### Testing Focus
- Unit tests for core components
- API endpoint integration tests
- Basic database CRUD operation tests
- Auth flow testing

## Phase 2: AI Integration (2-3 weeks)

### Technical Implementation
- OpenAI API integration
- Prompt engineering templates for different grade levels
- System prompt architecture for agent personality
- Basic prompt chaining implementation

### Features
- Simple chat interface for questions
- Basic topic-based assistance
- Grade-appropriate response formatting
- Subject-specific knowledge templates

### Testing Focus
- AI response validation testing
- Prompt template unit tests
- Response quality assessment framework
- API integration tests with OpenAI

## Phase 3: Learning Features (2-3 weeks)

### Technical Implementation
- Test generation system using LangChain or similar
- Quiz storage and retrieval
- Answer validation logic
- Performance tracking database tables

### Features
- Quiz/test generation by topic
- Answer checking mechanism
- Score tracking and history
- Basic performance analytics

### Testing Focus
- Test generation quality assessment
- Answer validation accuracy testing
- End-to-end quiz flow testing
- Performance data integrity tests

## Phase 4: Personalization & Polish (2-3 weeks)

### Technical Implementation
- Feedback collection mechanisms
- Learning style adaptation logic
- Historical interaction storage
- Performance metrics dashboard

### Features
- Thumbs up/down feedback system
- Adaptive difficulty based on performance
- Response style adjustment based on preferences
- Parent dashboard with basic analytics

### Testing Focus
- Usability testing for UI/UX
- Feedback loop integration tests
- Adaptation logic verification tests
- End-to-end system tests

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

- Vector storage for semantic understanding and retrieval
- Voice interaction capabilities
- Interactive visual learning elements
- Gamification features
- Advanced analytics dashboard
- Multi-language support
- Mobile application

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- React
